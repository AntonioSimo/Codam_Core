# C++ Modules
>Introduction to Modern C++

This repository contains a collection of projects that serve as an introduction to the C++ programming language, created as part of the 42 coding school curriculum.

Each folder corresponds to a distinct module, and together they form a structured learning path designed to guide you from the basics of C++ to more advanced and modern programming concepts. The projects are hands-on and progressive, covering a wide range of topics in both procedural and object-oriented paradigms.

The goal of these modules is to not only understand the syntax and capabilities of C++, but also to build a solid foundation in writing robust, maintainable, and expressive C++ code.

## Modules Overview
Here's a brief summary of the topics explored in each module:

- ### Module 00:
Introduction to C++ through the lens of someone coming from a C background. The focus is on Object-Oriented Programming fundamentals and understanding what makes C++ different.

- ### Module 01:
Covers memory management, references, and pointers to class members. Also introduces the use of switch statements in a C++ context.

- ### Module 02:
Delves into ad-hoc polymorphism through function overloading and introduces canonical form classes, helping to understand constructor and assignment operator best practices.

- ### Module 03:
Focuses on inheritance, how it works in C++, and how to design hierarchies of classes while avoiding common pitfalls.

- ### Module 04:
Introduces subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfacesâ€”key elements of designing flexible and scalable software architectures.

- ### Module 05:
Teaches exception handling using try and catch, how to write robust code that can handle errors gracefully.

- ### Module 06:
Explores different types of casting (static_cast, dynamic_cast, const_cast, and reinterpret_cast) and when each is appropriate.

- ### Module 07:
Introduces templates, allowing for generic programming and reusable components.

- ### Module 08:
Builds on templates with templated containers, iterators, and STL-style algorithms.

- ### Module 09:
Focuses entirely on C++ standard containers like vector, list, map, and how to use them effectively in real-world scenarios.
